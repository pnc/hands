### Examples

Find out the public IP of all of your instances:

    hands -e "instance.ip_address"

Find out the uptime of all of your instances (across all US regions) that are in an auto-scaling group with "production" and "Web" in its name:

    hands -k ~/.ssh/some-key.pem -a "*production*Web*" uptime

Get the public DNS name of all of your instances with names that match "logs":

    hands -n "*logs*" -e "instance.dns_name"

For `eval`, you can use any method listed in the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS/EC2/Instance.html).
